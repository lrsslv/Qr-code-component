### What I learned

Hi! So this was a very simple exercise solution that I made. That was actually the first project that I did all by myself, so I ended up very satisfied with the results.
I didn't learned anything new, but was nice to see that I was able to aplie some the things that I learned. But, I almost forgot how to align the text, so I strugled a little with that especific part that only needed to have the following solution:

```css
.qr-code .title {
    text-align: center;
}
```
For this project, was only that! Thank for reading until here.

### Continued development

I still feel like I need to learn more how to apllie flexbox or grid (this least wasan't used on this project), so I will keep my focus on learning that for now.
